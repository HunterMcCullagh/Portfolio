The premise of this project is to assist with the heating of sap to convert to maple syrup

The temperature probe with the DS18x20 is inserted into the liquid.
The barometer is used to calculate the environmental pressure to caluclate the boiling point of sap.

By knowing the boiling point of sap and having a temperature probe measuring the sap, 
users will have a better idea of when to take the syrup off of the heat source
