# Portfolio
Projects and examples of code, electrical, and mechanical design to demonstrate my proficiency

Plant Chamber:
The purpose of this project is to create an environment to successfully germinate and grow plant life

A diagram of the components can be seen below. Where Temperature & airflow are controlled.

Next steps for this project is to integrate humidity control


Maple Meter:
The purpose of this project is to replace the hydrometer, a device used to measure the density of a liquid while boiling sap into maple syrup.

The reason the hydrometer is used is to ensure that the boiled maple tree sap is the correct density for it to be considered maple syrup

The Maple Meter measures the temperature of the boiling sap with a DS18XB20 temperature probe and uses the BMP388 to measure barometric pressure of the environment. Both types if sensor data are then used to determine if the maple syrup has reached the correct density.

The advantage of this is that it provides a constant stream of updates when compared to the hydrometer as it requires the sap to be poured into a specific measuring vial

A 3D view of the PCB can be seen below
